A jury has yet to be seated in the "Whitey" Bulger trial.
But proceedings are already focusing on the conduct of lawmen.
Bulger is charged in the killings of 19 people as the leader of south Boston's Winter Hill gang..
Prosecutors say he was an FBI informant whose handler tipped him off to charges against him.
