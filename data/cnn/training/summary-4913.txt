NEW: Arraignment is postponed until October for Marilyn Edge, facing felony murder charges.
Her two children were found dead in a California hotel over the weekend.
Her ex-husband's lawyer says she had been ordered to turn over the children last week.
Edge was apprehended after apparently trying to commit suicide on Saturday night.
