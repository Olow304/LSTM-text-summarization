The British Film Institute is releasing the full 144-minute version of The Shining.
CNN's Neil Curry found mysterious 'orbs' on his family's pictures of the hotel that helped inspire Stephen King to write the horror novel.
"It's amazing how this film invited speculation and fantasy in the audience," said the film's executive producer Jan Harlan.
Neil Curry: If there is anyone out there with a good theory about the pictures we'd love to hear from you.
