Maryland couple open their indoor train garden to the public each holiday season.
Model train collection started with a train given to John Sturgeon as an infant.
The collection has grown to 11 intertwined train sets divided into summer and winter scenes.
The Sturgeons built a detached garage for the display, which drew 1,200 visitors last year.
