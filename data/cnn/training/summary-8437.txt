Foreign ministry denies reports that Meriam Yehya Abrahim would be released.
She has been condemned to die by hanging and gave birth to a baby girl this week at a Sudanese prison.
A Sudanese court issued the sentence after she refused to renounce her Christian faith.
Her husband says she's holding firm to her beliefs regardless of circumstances.
