An Atlanta radio station fires three hosts for mocking ex-Saints player Steve Gleason.
Gleason has ALS and speaks with a synthetic voice, which the hosts spoofed.
Accepting the hosts' apologies, Gleason says he hopes more learn about ALS.
A New Orleans-based radio host says the hosts shouldn't have been fired.
