Mehdi Karrubi has not been in contact with his wife since July 16, she says, according to campaigners.
Activists fear he is under psychological pressure to make a televised confession.
He and Mir Hossein Moussavi came under restrictions in February.
Iranian officials have apparently not commented on the reports about Karrubi.
