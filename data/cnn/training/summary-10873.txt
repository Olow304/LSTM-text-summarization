Dean Obeidallah: Candidates, campaigns have been making lots of gaffes lately.
He says candidates quickly backpedal from gaffes, but the public knows better.
He says these comments are less gaffes than accurate reads of a candidates viewpoints.
Obeidallah: We should applaud gaffes as a chance to see who's suited for the job.
