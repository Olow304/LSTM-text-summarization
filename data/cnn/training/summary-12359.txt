South African prosecutors to appeal verdict and sentence in the Oscar Pistorius case.
Appeal doesn't mean Pistorius is getting out, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps says.
The verdict can be changed only if a court rules the judge misapplied law, Phelps says.
Sentence must be found to be "shockingly inappropriate" if appeal is to succeed, she says.
