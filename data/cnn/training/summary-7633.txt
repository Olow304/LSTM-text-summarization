NEW: India orders a club at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi to halt commercial activities.
U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz will no longer visit India next week, an official says.
The postponement comes amid tensions over the arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York.
Indian officials have expressed outrage that the female diplomat was strip-searched.
