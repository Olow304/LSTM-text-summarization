Villagers in Guyana work together to build a library with donated books, computers.
Part of a communal dream, some painted, while others shelved donated books.
The Bible was the only book many villagers had ever seen or touched before the new library.
If you want to donate books, go to village's Facebook page or to Better World Books.
