Scaffolding caught fire on a dock in northwest Russia, state media reports.
The flames spread to the hull of a docked nuclear submarine.
The fire was "localized" early Friday, an official tells a state news agency.
A local governor says the sub's reactors were shut down and radiation didn't spread.
