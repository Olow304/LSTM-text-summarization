NEW: The Tibetan man who set himself on fire in Nepal has died, police say.
The 100th Tibetan to self-immolate inside China is a former monk, Free Tibet says.
He set himself on fire on February 3, but it took time for news of the act to emerge.
Dozens of Tibetans have self-immolated in recent years to protest Chinese rule.
