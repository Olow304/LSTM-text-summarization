Mohammed Abu Khdeir woke up early to go to a mosque for Ramadan prayers.
Instead, the 16-year-old was abducted, then killed in his hometown of Jerusalem.
A friend recalls Abu Khdeir, who would have graduated high school next year, as kind.
"Everyone loves him," his mother says of a boy who "never gets into trouble at all".
