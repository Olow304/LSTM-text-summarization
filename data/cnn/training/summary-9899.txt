Ferguson police chief: His department's officers never intentionally targeted blacks.
Chief Jackson says he wants to stay on the job: "This is mine, and I'm taking ownership of it".
Jackson apologized in a video statement to the Brown family, peaceful protesters.
He says he's sorry it "took so long to remove Michael from the street" after shooting.
