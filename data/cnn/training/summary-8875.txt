Carlos Ghosn says Renault-Nissan is targeting an autonomous vehicle within the next decade.
Driverless cars have appeared in a number of sci-fi movies including Hollywood hits I, Robot and Minority Report.
Ghosn said some of the technology needed for a driverless car is in the Nissan's new Qashqai model.
