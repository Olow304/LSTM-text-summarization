Israeli spy agency used Milchan's companies to make weapons-related purchases.
"I did it for my country and I'm proud of it," Arnon Milchan told an Israeli TV interviewer.
Milchan's films include "Fight Club," "Pretty Woman," and "L.A. Confidential".
A 2011 book detailed his secret work, but until now he has not talked openly about his spying.
