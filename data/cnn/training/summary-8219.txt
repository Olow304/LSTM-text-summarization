Musharraf's rise through the military helped him cement his political power in Pakistan.
He deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a bloodless coup in 1999.
Musharraf's popularity plummeted in 2007 after he suspended a senior judge.
He now says he'll return to his country between January 27 and 30, 2012.
