Matthias Lanzinger underwent leg amputation after crashing heavily on the World Cup circuit.
Austrian skier gave up hope of skiing again but is now targeting medals at the Sochi Paralympics.
A three-time medallist at this year's World Championships, Lanzinger is a strong contender.
To this day, he still cannot watch back the accident - "I don't see any benefits at all".
