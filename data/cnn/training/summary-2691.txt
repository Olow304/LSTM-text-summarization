English Premier League side Chelsea confirm Nicolas Anelka will move to China.
Shanghai Shenhua earlier claimed to have signed Frenchman on a two-year deal.
Images of the 32-year-old were splashed across the Shanghai team's official website.
The striker has rarely featured for Chelsea this season under manager Andre Villas-Boas.
