Riders for Health provides motorbikes to improve health care in rural Africa.
The group manages over 1,400 motorcycles and other vehicles in seven African countries.
Local technicians maintain the vehicles so they don't break down.
RFH bikers transport medical samples and test results between rural clinics and labs.
