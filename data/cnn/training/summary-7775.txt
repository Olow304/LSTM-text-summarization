Jeff Pearlman says Mark McGwire owed (and delivered) apology to Roger Maris' wife, Pat.
He says steroid user apologies have given a new, ignoble, meaning to  "manning up".
Even Costas' questions couldn't get McGwire to show grasp of offense, he says.
Pearlman: McGwire still doesn't see what he did.
