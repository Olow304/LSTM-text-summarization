Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared early Saturday with more than 200 aboard.
Peter Bergen says passenger jet disasters lead often to conspiracy theories.
He notes that people questioned government findings on TWA Flight 800 and Pan Am 103.
Bergen: The truth will come out after a careful and lengthy investigation.
