Diplodocus longus dinosaurs are believed to have roamed Earth 150 million years ago.
Some museums house rare Diplodocus longus skeletons or plaster replicas.
The sons of paleontologist Raimond Albersdoerfer found a complete skeleton in Wyoming.
The skeleton -- known as "Misty" -- will be auctioned in late November in England.
