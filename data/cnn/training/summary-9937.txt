Ganesh Shinde, 42, has been clearing human waste in Mumbai since 2007.
It's called manual scavenging -- the removal of human waste from sites with no flush system.
Life expectancy is low, with many developing asthma, skin infections and tuberculosis.
The majority are Dalits -- people belonging to the lowest strata of India's caste system.
