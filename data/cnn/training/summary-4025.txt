Bob Greene: A theater troupe put on a play at various spots along 8 miles of Minnesota River.
He says audience travels to scenes by canoe, pulls up to bank to watch from the river.
He says creators of play want to deliver a sense of place to audiences.
Greene: Like "Waiting for Guffman," play celebrates community sweetly, sincerely.
