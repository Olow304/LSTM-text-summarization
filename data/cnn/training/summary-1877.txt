Saudi authorities beheaded Rizana Nafeek, a Sri Lankan woman.
She was convicted of killing a baby of the family employing her as a housemaid.
This was despite Nafeek's claims that the baby died in a choking accident.
Becker says her fate "should spotlight the precarious existence of domestic workers".
