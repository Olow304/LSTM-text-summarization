New: New Jersey Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno says accusations by Hoboken Mayor are "false".
Guadagno says she did not deliver an ultimatum on behalf of Gov. Chris Christie.
Her remarks will be the first time a senior Christie official has addressed the charges.
Hoboken's Mayor says Guadagno told her that Sandy relief funds hinged on her backing real estate venture.
