On November 21, Ukraine's government decided to suspend talks with the European Union.
The decision has sparked the biggest protests since the 2004 Orange Revolution.
Joerg Forbrig says President Victor Yanukovich has ignored the will of the majority.
It is now up to the EU to engage Kiev and protesters in a national dialogue, he says.
