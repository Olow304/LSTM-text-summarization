Israeli official: Catholic bishops' conference was "hijacked by an anti-Israel majority".
An archbishop said Saturday that Israel is not the Jews' promised land.
Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon calls the archbishop's remark "libel".
Bishops are pushing the U.N. to work for a two-state solution.
