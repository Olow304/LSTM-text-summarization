Lindsey Wright makes strong start to Kraft Nabisco Championship, one shot off lead.
The Australian recently took time away from golf to battle with depression.
Wright says on some nights she drank two bottles of wine to help her sleep.
She won the New Zealand Open in February, a month after returning to the sport.
