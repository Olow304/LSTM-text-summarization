About 750 Americans are currently in the Israeli military, an advocacy group says.
In Israel, military service is required of all citizens at age 18, male and female.
That includes young Americans with dual citizenship living in Israel.
Those outside Israel can apply if they meet requirements including speaking Hebrew.
