NEW: With snow coming, authorities continue to hunt for the suspect near Big Bear Lake.
Police believe former cop Christopher Jordan Dorner shot three officers, killing one.
This was days after he allegedly killed two people, one a retired LAPD officer's daughter.
In an 11-page manifesto, Dorner promises "war" on police and their families.
