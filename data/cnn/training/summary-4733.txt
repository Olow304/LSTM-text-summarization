Jim Carr: Forced spending cuts are now under way. Where will the jobs come from?.
He says cuts will cause pain in U.S. households; economists say more than 700,000 jobs lost.
He says at the same time corporate earnings up, widening gap between rich, poor.
Carr: Cuts don't address any debt crisis; what's needed is investment in job-building.
