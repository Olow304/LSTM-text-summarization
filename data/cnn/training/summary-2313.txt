Ocean Sole is a company turning broken flip-flops into colorful animal sculptures.
Masses of rubber sandals blight beaches and waterways, creating an eco-disaster.
Kenya-based Ocean Sole aims to recycle some 400,000 flip-flops every year.
The company sells its creations in zoos, aquariums and stores around the world.
