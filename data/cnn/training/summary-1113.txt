NEW: Hospital "denies each and every" allegation by woman's family.
Family has said Marlise Munoz is brain dead, and medical records now prove it, lawyers say.
Munoz was 14 weeks' pregnant when stricken, and hospital has said it must follow state law.
Family: Munoz has no life to sustain, and hospital's treatment is "cruel and obscene mutilation".
