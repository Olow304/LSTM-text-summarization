George Hopkins was flight engineer on Pan Am flight hijacked to Cuba in 1968.
Arrest of last suspect brings back memories of gun in his face, hijacker in cockpit.
"There was no doubt in my mind he would pull the trigger," Hopkins remembers.
One hijacker asked to have his wife and baby moved to first class, Hopkins recalls.
