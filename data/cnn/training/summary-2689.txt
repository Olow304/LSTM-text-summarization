Two U.S. military officials say the Syrian regime fired at least two Fateh A-110 missiles.
The move is an apparent attempt to more precisely target rebel forces, the officials say.
They decline to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information.
The missiles are more accurate than older Scuds, which have a longer range.
