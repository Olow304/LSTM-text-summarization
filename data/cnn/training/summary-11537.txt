China says it will end organ transplants from executed prisoners from January 1.
Traditional beliefs discourage organ donation in China and rates are very low.
Donors are also put off by fears their organs may end up traded for profit.
Cultural beliefs make it difficult to end the reliance on convicts' organs.
