Researchers have developed a robot that could help the US Navy battle shipboard fires.
The robot has been designed in a humanoid shape to negotiate complex environments.
Not only would the robot, called SAFFiR, throw fire retarding grenades but glean information.
Researchers hope the robot will one day help with other difficult and onerous onboard tasks.
