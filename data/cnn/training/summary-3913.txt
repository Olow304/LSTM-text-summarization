Falkland Island residents are voting on whether to remain a British Overseas Territory.
Argentina, which knows the islands as Las Malvinas, disputes British sovereignty.
The UK government says the islanders have a right to self-determination.
Britain and Argentina went to war over the South Atlantic territory in 1982.
