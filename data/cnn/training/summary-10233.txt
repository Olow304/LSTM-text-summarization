Ohioans will vote Tuesday on whether to repeal Senate Bill 5.
Paul Sracic says the battle over the repeal could be first skirmish in 2012 election.
He says unions and Democrats mobilized to repeal law restricting collective bargaining.
Sracic: If the law is repealed, it may embolden and strengthen Obama's allies.
