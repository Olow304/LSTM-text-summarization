The shooting at Arapahoe High School in Centennial began just after 12:30 p.m..
Janitor Fabian Llerenas saw a student armed with a shotgun, running military-style.
"We were shaking. We were crying," 9th-grader Whitney Riley said.
Eric Waugh and his classmate thought initially it was an explosion in a chemistry class.
