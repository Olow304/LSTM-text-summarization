Burt Reynolds is "feeling better," though still in the ICU with flu symptoms, his rep says.
He likely will be released from the hospital on Monday, the actor's representative adds.
Reynolds was one of America's most popular actors in the 1970s and 1980s.
He starred in "Deliverance," the "Smokey and the Bandit" series and "Boogie Nights".
