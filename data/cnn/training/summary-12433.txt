A letter sent to an Ontario woman's house calls her grandson a "nuisance".
It urges his family to do "the right thing and move or euthanize him!".
Police say they are considering criminal charges against the letter writer.
But "despite the hateful language," they say, the words don't qualify as a hate crime.
