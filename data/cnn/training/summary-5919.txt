Tim Stanley: Report about sex abuse of 1,400 children shocked Britain. How could it happen?.
He says some blame authorities' PC reluctance to intervene; offenders were Pakistani.
But he says blame, too, an institutional betrayal by police, social services and politicians.
Stanley: Britain must face hidden sex abuse, unpunished negligence. Inquiry must bring justice.
