Sex workers will operate from garage-style structures with alarm buttons and guards.
The move is intended to take prostitution off the streets of Zurich, says project leader.
Some 30 to 40 women are expected to work at the site in Sihlquai each night.
The women can get health checkups on site, as well as advice from social workers.
