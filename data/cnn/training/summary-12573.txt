Kathleen McCartney believed modern motherhood is a cultural invention, not biological destiny.
As a mom in '80s, she was a primary caretaker, but thought cultural attitudes would change.
She says nothing changed; child care, flex time, baby leave are still considered women's issues.
McCartney: Workplace equality won't improve until these are considered "parental" concerns.
