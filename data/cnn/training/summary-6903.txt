Todd Graham: Romney played to his strengths, Obama to his weaknesses in debate.
He says Romney aced keeping "smooth" from turning "slick".
Obama's lack of passion kept him from connecting with voters; he missed chances to hit back.
Graham: Obama needs to heat up, pin Romney down; Romney must keep aggression in check.
