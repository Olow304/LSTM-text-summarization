Artist Prune Nourry's show, "Terracotta Daughters," opens in New York on Wednesday.
Creating female terra-cotta warriors is a way to address the issue of gender imbalance.
Due to cultural preference for boys, China will have a big surplus of men, which is a problem.
Nourry worked with local craftsmen in China to make each female terra-cotta statue unique.
