CNN's Robert Yoon shared a birthday with his schoolmate Brian Hull.
Yoon thought they had little in common, but a friendship slowly formed.
The pair promised to stay in contact after school ended but life got in the way.
When Hull died at age 22, Yoon realized friendship is a treasure to be preserved.
