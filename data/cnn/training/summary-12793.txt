Bob Greene: When Andy Griffith died, most recalled him as the aw-shucks Sherriff Andy Taylor.
But a stunning performance he gave earlier in his first film was the antithesis of his TV role.
In "A Face in the Crowd" Griffith played a drifter-turned-star, an oily, monstrous character.
Greene: Griffith owns the movie; you should see it to understand how good Griffith was.
