Israel plans to begin construction of settlements in the East 1, or E1, zone in the West Bank.
Comes after the U.N. voted to grant Palestine non-member observer status.
Palestinians believe construction here would essentially cut the West Bank in half.
Group: Currently 137 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, with about 325,000 inhabitants.
