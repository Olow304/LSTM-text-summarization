Logs of reports to Inspector General's hotline are made public.
Among the reports are allegations of misconduct by Secret Service personnel.
Those reports make up only a small portion of the eight years of records, officials say.
The logs were released as part of a FOIA request over the Secret Service scandal in Colombia.
