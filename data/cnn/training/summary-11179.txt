John Cornyn: Obama's defense secretary nominee, Chuck Hagel, is wrong for the job.
His actions show he doesn't grasp the magnitude of Iran's threat, Cornyn says.
Cornyn says Hagel opposed Iran sanctions, urged Bush to hold talks.
Cornyn: With Hagel pick, Obama has sent the worst message to allies and foes.
