A new comedy starring James Franco is about a plot to assassinate Kim Jong Un.
North Korea says the movie hurts "the dignity of the supreme leadership".
Distributing the film is "the most undisguised terrorism and a war action," an official says.
Comedians have taken shots at the regime in the past, notably in "Team America".
