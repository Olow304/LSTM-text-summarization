Melinda Hunt, 53, has made her life's work documenting the undocumented at Hart Island.
The island is reportedly the nation's largest taxpayer-funded potter's field.
It took Elaine Joseph decades to locate her baby's likely burial site; Hunt helped her do it.
Hunt also helped Lisa-Michele Russo track down her twin brother, who died at birth.
