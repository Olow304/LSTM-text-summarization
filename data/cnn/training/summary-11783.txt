The NFL is reminding players and other league employees that women journalists should be treated with respect.
The reminder comes in the wake of allegations that sports reporter Ines Sainz was harassed.
The NFL is also warning players that women reporters must be granted the same access as men.
Sainz received an apology from the Jets owner after an incident last Saturday.
