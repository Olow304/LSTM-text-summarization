NEW: Anbar Province leader: Iraqi forces fought on ground near Haditha.
U.S. says it carried out the airstrikes near Haditha Dam at the request of Iraq.
Failure of the dam would affect millions of people who depend on it for their water.
Earlier this year, ISIS fighters opened the gates of Falluja Dam and flooded villages.
