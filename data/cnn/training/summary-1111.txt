Steve Williams: "I sincerely apologize to Tiger and anyone else I have offended".
The New Zealander was sacked by Tiger Woods in July after 13 years together.
He now caddies for Australian golfer Adam Scott, who says he will not sack him.
Woods' agent says Williams' comments at awards dinner were "regrettable".
