A panel of doctors finds Olympian Oscar Pistorius mentally fit to stand trial.
Pistorius is accused of deliberately shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
He says he shot Steenkamp accidentally in his bathroom, mistaking her for an intruder.
The trial was halted in May after the judge ordered Pistorius to undergo psychiatric tests.
