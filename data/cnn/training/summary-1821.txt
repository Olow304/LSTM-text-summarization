Greg Buckley Jr. was gunned down by the forces he had been training.
"He told me, if I have to stay here until November... I'm not going to come home," his dad said.
The phenomenon is known as "green-on-blue" and is disturbingly more frequent in Afghanistan.
Buckley warned superiors an insider attack could happen, his father says; CNN could not confirm.
