Photojournalist Jonathan Alpeyrie returned to Donetsk, Ukraine, two weeks ago.
Donetsk is held by pro-Russian rebels but the Ukrainian Army has gradually encircled it.
Alpeyrie's photographs show the life of the residents surviving under siege.
The images show them sheltering in cellars or clearing rubble from their homes.
