Seventeen publishes a "Body Peace Treaty" vowing to show "real girls and models".
It's in response to a teen-led petition signed by 84,000 calling photo altering dangerous.
The teen behind that petition celebrates a "huge victory" after the magazine's announcement.
But an ex-model questions why the magazine didn't admit to ever seriously altering images.
