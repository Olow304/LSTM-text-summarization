NEW: Law professor says the Prop 8 ruling is not relevant to the Deen case.
A white woman can't sue for racial discrimination, Deen's lawyer argues.
Deen's motion cites last week's Supreme Court ruling on California's Prop 8.
The high court ruled private citizens had "no standing" to appeal same-sex ruling.
