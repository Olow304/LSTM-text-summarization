Julian Zelizer: Mitt Romney made what some see as a bold choice in Paul Ryan.
Many believe McCain's choice of Palin in 2008 helped torpedo his chances, Zelizer says.
But it is important to remember how many VP picks have helped the ticket, he says.
Zelizer: Romney could use a boost, since he's 7 points behind Obama in the latest CNN poll.
