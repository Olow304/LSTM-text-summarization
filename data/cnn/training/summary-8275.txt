Dutch prince Johan Friso has suffered from brain damage, his doctor says.
He was injured in an avalanche at an Austrian ski resort last week.
Friso, a son of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, was airlifted to hospital in Innsbruck.
Lech am Arlberg is in Austria's Vorarlberg state, a popular skiing area in western Austria.
