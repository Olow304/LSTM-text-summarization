Nigeria's information minister says President Umaru Yar'Adua has died.
Yar'Adua had given amnesty to armed militants in troubled oil-rich Niger Delta region.
He went to Saudi Arabia in November for heart treatment.
Yar'Adua took office in 2007 in election mired in controversy, accusations of vote-rigging.
