Wurlitzer organ at the Tuschinksi Theater in Amsterdam dates to the theater's opening in the 1920s.
A team of enthusiasts helps keep the organ in its its musical prime using odds and ends to replace parts no longer available.
The organ still attracts fans, playing to visitors on guided tours of the cinema.
