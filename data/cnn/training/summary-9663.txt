Harry Bostick, a convicted DUI felon, was arrested in October for drunken driving.
He was involved in a crash that killed 18-year-old Charity Smith.
At the time, Mississippi's parole board had approved his pardon request.
E-mails show that governor's office knew about fourth arrest before his pardon.
