NEW: Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords says 'good guy with a gun' doesn't work.
Paralyzed on her right side and partly blind after being shot, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords defines a 'new normal'.
Giffords and husband live in the same house, same state for the first time in their marriage.
Even with moments of frustration, Giffords insists she is mostly optimistic and not resentful.
