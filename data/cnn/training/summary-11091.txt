Several hearings in the case of Chandra Levy, a D.C. intern who was killed, have been held.
Substantive matters are under seal and will remain so, a judge ruled Thursday.
Several media outlets have requested access to the transcripts of those matters.
Levy's disappearance captured media attention because of her affair with a congressman.
