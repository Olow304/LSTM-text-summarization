The Old City of Homs in Syria has been under siege for nearly two years.
Food and medical supplies have been cut off, leaving hungry, angry residents behind.
The Geneva peace talks produced a small deal to evacuate women and children.
"We do not want your food or your aid supplies. We want to break the siege," resident says.
