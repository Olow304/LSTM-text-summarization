NEW: Another attempt could happen this week, perhaps Thursday.
Felix Baumgartner hopes to be the first person to break the sound barrier without a vehicle.
Risks include low temperatures, thin atmosphere and a possible loss of consciousness.
Baumgartner will have only a space suit, helmet and chute for the 120,000-foot jump.
