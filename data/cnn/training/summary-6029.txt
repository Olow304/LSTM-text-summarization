NEW: Argentina's president calls the Falkland Islands referendum a "parody".
Britain will always defend the people of the Falklands, Cameron said.
Overwhelming percentage of voters said they want the Falklands to remain a territory.
Argentina, which knows the islands as Las Malvinas, disputes British sovereignty.
