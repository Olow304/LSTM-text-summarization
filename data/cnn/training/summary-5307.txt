Joran van der Sloot is charged with murdering a woman in a Lima hotel room.
Last week, his lawyer said van der Sloot would plead guilty and make a "sincere confession".
Instead, he voiced doubt about the charge and was granted more time to "reflect".
He is expected to make a decision Wednesday, which will determine what happens next.
