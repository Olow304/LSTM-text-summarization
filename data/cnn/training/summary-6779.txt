Jim Swire, whose daughter died in the bombing of Pan Am 103, saw bomber last week.
Swire does not believe that Abdelbeset al-Megrahi is guilty.
Al-Megrahi was freed last year on the grounds that he was likely to live only a few months.
270 people died in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in 1988.
