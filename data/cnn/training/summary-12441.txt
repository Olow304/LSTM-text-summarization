North Korea launched a long-range rocket earlier this month.
It says it was to launch a satellite; critics say it was to test missile technology.
South Korea finds and analyzes an oxidizer tank used in the launch.
Its officials say their analysis shows the rocket could go over 6,000 miles, carry 275 pounds.
