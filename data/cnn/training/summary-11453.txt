Former Lance Armstrong sponsor Oakley says it is "sad" but not angry about his demise.
Chief executive Colin Baden says he is "left with the grief of what was a great story".
He says Oakley will not follow other bodies by asking for its money back.
Baden: Armstrong was a key endorser due to his worldwide popularity.
