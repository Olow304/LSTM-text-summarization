Ecuadorian consul in London will face sanctions for giving travel papers to Snowden.
VP Joe Biden asks Ecuador "to please reject" any asylum request from Edward Snowden.
But Snowden hasn't made any asylum request, Ecuador President Rafael Correa says.
"We have to act very carefully but with courage," Correa says.
