Dennis Cheng, who has started to build Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign finance team, is leaving the Clinton Foundation this week.
Cheng is a longtime Clinton aide who has worked at the foundation for the last four years.
"Dennis led our efforts to secure the Foundation's future by raising a $248 million endowment," said the foundation's spokesman.
