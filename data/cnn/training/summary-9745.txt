Jamie Hein is asking the state civil rights commission to reconsider its ruling.
The commission has previously ruled Hein violated the Ohio Civil Rights Act.
Hein put up a "Public Swimming Pool, White Only" sign at her pool.
A former tenant says the sign was put up after his biracial daughter swam in the pool.
