Edgar Davids says the problem of racism in football is not being addressed.
The former AC Milan star has been involved in a war of words with Johan Cruyff.
Davids tells CNN that action must be taken when racist abuse occurs.
He says the Dutch press have "let slide" Cruyff's comments at a board meeting.
