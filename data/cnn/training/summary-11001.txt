John Stoehr: GOP uses North Carolina's lowered jobless rate in unemployment debate.
He says rate fell after benefits slashed. GOP argues benefits make people turn down jobs.
This gives GOP cover for not extending jobless benefits, he says. But it masks economic reality.
Stoehr: N.C. rate reflects people no longer looking for jobs. Where is GOP's solution?.
