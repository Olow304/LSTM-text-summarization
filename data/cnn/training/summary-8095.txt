Creature effects artist Stuart Freeborn fashioned Yoda in his own image.
He also helped create Chewbacca, Jabba the Hutt and the creatures in the bar scene.
He also created the apelike ancestors in "2001: A Space Odyssey".
"His artistry and craftsmanship will live on ... in the characters he created," Lucas says.
