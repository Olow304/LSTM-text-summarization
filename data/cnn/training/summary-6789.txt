Lake Superior State University releases its 37th annual list of banished words and phrases.
"Amazing," "baby bump" and "man cave" are among those people asked not to be used.
Others on the list include "ginormous," "win the future," and "thank you in advance".
The roster of unwanted words first came about at a New Year's Eve party in 1975.
