Construction workers digging a tunnel in London have found about 20 Roman-era skulls.
The workers were digging a tunnel for the Crossrail rail project spanning the city.
Archaeologists believe the skulls were washed down stream from an old burial ground.
More than 10,000 archaeological items have been found since the project began in 2009.
