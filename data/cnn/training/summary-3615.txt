May 15 marks the "Nakba" exodus of Palestinians after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.
During protests in the West Bank this year, two Palestinian youths were shot dead.
Israel's military says the protest was extremely violent but that "no live fire was shot".
But one of the dead teenager's fathers alleges his son was "assassinated in cold blood".
