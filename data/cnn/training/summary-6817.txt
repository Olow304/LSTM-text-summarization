Al-Shabaab is an al-Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia.
It was once allied with Sharia courts, which tried to impose order on the lawless country.
The U.S. government designated Al-Shabaab as a foreign terrorist group in 2008.
Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the deadly attack at a Kenyan mall in September 2013.
