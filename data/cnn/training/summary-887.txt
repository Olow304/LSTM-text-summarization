A military-style rifle was used in the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting.
"Can't we leave those guns to the trained military?" asks a CNN commenter.
Many gun owners collect them, using them for hunting, target shooting and protection.
"A lot of people buy the AR-15 because, well, it's cool," says a former owner.
