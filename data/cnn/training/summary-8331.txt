NEW: Darrel Mohler, another relative, charged with two counts of rape Friday.
Five relatives were arrested Tuesday after six people accused them of abuse.
More alleged victims have come forward since initial arrests, police say.
Allegations date from the mid-1980s through at least the mid-'90s, the sheriff said.
