Edward Brunton hanged himself with a belt in a closet in 2009, coroner spokesman says.
The closet protected his body from rapid decomposition, coroner says.
Neighbors thought his home was abandoned; its yard was overgrown.
Brunton was estranged from his family and friends, and no one reported him missing.
