Prime minister says dzong, destroyed by fire on Sunday, will be rebuilt.
Dzong not only housed temples but served as administrative seat for district.
Most of the dzong's sacred relics -- hundreds of them -- were saved, home minister says.
King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and queen have been on scene since the fire.
