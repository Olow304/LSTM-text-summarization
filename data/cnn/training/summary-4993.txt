Carrie Rickey: Clint Eastwood lines have long been used by politicians, mainly from right.
She says last night at GOP convention, he made rambling, performance-art-type speech.
She says left-leaners groused, but Eastwood going his own way politically is not new.
Rickey: He's small "l" libertarian, with films showing ambivalence about America. And that's OK.
