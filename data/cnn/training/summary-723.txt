Papers about evidence collected in Aaron Hernandez case should be released, judge says.
Ruling stems from filing from several media outlets requesting the papers, available Tuesday.
Hernandez's defense team opposes the ruling and has the option to appeal.
Hernandez is charged with premeditated murder in the slaying of Odin Lloyd.
