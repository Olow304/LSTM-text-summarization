David Frum: Venezuela's Hugo Chavez has won; his system of rule suspect, sinister.
He says Venezuela election fraud system evident in rigged media, vote-buying, police threat.
He says robberies and eavesdropping routine, economy in awful shape under Chavez.
Frum: Did Venezuelans really vote for this? Hard to say in a society like it.
