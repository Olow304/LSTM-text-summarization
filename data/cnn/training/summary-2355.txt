Former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy says Jackson "is getting the help he needs".
Jackson is a patient at Minnesota's famed Mayo Clinic.
Jackson may announce whether he will stay in office in a couple weeks, Kennedy says.
Kennedy says stress "clearly, I think" played a role in Jackson's outbreak of illness.
