A Pennsylvania jury convicts Robert Ferrante of murder in his wife's death.
Ferrante, who managed a scientific lab, bought cyanide just before she fell ill.
Authorities say the wife, Dr. Autumn Klein, was killed by cyanide poisoning.
A juror says: "The facts were clear, and I couldn't argue with them".
