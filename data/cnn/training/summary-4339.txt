NEW: Park officials have no plans to kill the bear, saying it was "not predatory".
Brian Matayoshi, 57, was killed while hiking with his wife.
The couple surprised the grizzly and her cubs, Yellowstone Park officials say.
The incident is the first bear-caused human fatality in Yellowstone since 1986.
