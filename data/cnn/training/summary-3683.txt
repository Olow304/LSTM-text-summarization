Jordan Belfi plays acting agent Adam Davies on the HBO show "Entourage".
Belfi has played Ari Gold's nemesis on the show since the first season.
"I think he's the kind of agent that I'd certainly like to have," Belfi says of Davies.
A little something about coming story lines: Belfi says Adam might get Lloyd.
