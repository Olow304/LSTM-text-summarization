Danny Cevallos: Justin Bieber is petulant and sarcastic in a videotaped deposition.
Cevallos: Bieber should know this is not an interview: Interruptions just hurt his side.
Cevallos: Depositions are not soapboxes; you aren't there to match wits and bicker.
Cevallos says all you say in a deposition is fodder for lawyers, so the less you say the better.
