Court records show Colton Harris-Moore as a wayward boy with frequent run-ins with the law.
Harris-Moore complained about his mother's behavior when drinking, according to the records.
His father left when he was 4 or 5 and he became attached to his stepfather, who later died.
'He does things without thinking of the end results,' his mother wrote the court about her son.
