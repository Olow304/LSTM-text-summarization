Borko Ilincic, a 33-year-old Serbian man, has been arrested in a Madrid suburb.
Police say he took part in a bold robbery of a jewelry store in Dubai in 2007.
Spanish police say Ilincic is a suspected member of the Pink Panthers gang.
The gang's behind jewelry store robberies in Europe, the Mideast, Asia and the U.S., Interpol says.
