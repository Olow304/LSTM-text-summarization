Port-au-Prince airport "can't handle all the aid," Oxfam spokesman says.
Hundreds of planes trying to land at airport, which has one runway, military officer says.
Oxfam: Phone line damage makes it difficult for aid agencies to communicate.
Northern Haiti hospital: We have plenty of free beds, but no easy way to get patients here.
