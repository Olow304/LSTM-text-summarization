Suraya Pakzad and other Afghan women's rights advocates visit Washington.
They're urging the U.S. to be careful in making any deal with Taliban moderates.
Pakzad says a U.S.-Taliban deal could threaten Afghan women's hard-won rights.
"It makes me scared" that Taliban might regain strength, Pakzad says.
