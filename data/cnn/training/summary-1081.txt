Vardzia is an isolated mountain valley, home to a 12th century cave monastery.
In 800 years it's been destroyed by an earthquake and damaged by invading armies.
It looks deserted, but the caves have some dedicated residents: seven Orthodox monks.
Tourists boost the local economy, but they are also disturbing the monks' way of life.
