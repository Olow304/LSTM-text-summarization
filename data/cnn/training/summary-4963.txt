Mustafa Akyol: Syria downing of Turkish plane has brought countries' tensions to new level.
He says relations had evolved to friendly until Arab Spring; Syria aggression opened new divide.
He says Turkey's Erdogan had tried to ease Syria to peace, but now it's in military posture.
Akyol: Turkey used "soft power" to gain regional strength. Must it use "hard power' to keep it?.
