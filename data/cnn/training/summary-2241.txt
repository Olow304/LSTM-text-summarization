Six men have been charged on sexual abuse allegations dating back to mid-1980s.
Neighbor of suspect David Mohler calls the allegations "absolutely unbelievable".
The sixth family member was arrested Friday at his Florida home.
Three of the men are lay ministers with the Community of Christ organization.
