NEW: "These deaths could and should have been prevented," says Oxfam.
Nearly 260,000 people died between October 2010 and April 2012, a new study says.
Half of the famine victims were children aged under 5, the report says.
"The suffering played out like a drama without witnesses," says Philippe Lazzarini.
