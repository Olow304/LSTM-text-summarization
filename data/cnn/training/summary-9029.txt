Two Ciudad Juarez bus drivers were slain last month by an unidentified woman.
Shooter reportedly sent e-mails saying the killings were to avenge women raped by drivers.
Some drivers, fearful of being shot, have not shown up for work.
Commuter: "Of course we're afraid. ... but we still have to get to our destination.".
