Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been convicted of misappropriation.
A court freed him from detention on July 19, pending an appeal of the court's ruling against him.
Navalny famously branded the ruling United Russia party "the party of crooks and thieves".
He claims his trial was politically motivated, an allegation the authorities have denied.
