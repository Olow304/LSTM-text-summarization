Republicanism in Australian and NZ seems to be in reversal, says Philippa Mein Smith.
Mein Smith says neither country's current prime minister will create a republic.
But she says the two countries' positions differ, with NZ historically the more loyal.
Australians' vote not to become a republic was in part due to distrust of politicians, she says.
