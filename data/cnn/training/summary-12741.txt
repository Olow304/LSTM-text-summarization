KISS will play 9 nights in November at the Hard Rock in Vegas.
The Vegas miniresidency is a first for KISS, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary.
A growing list of acts, including Olivia Newton John and Britney Spears, is playing Vegas.
"What happens in Vegas will not stay in Vegas," KISS co-founder Gene Simmons says.
