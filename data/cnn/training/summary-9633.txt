Lyndon B. Johnson's campaign aired the "Daisy" ad on September 7, 1964.
The controversial ad targeted his opponent, Republican Barry Goldwater.
Experts say the spot, considered the first political attack ad, changed politics.
Monique Luiz, the girl who starred in the ad, never saw the full thing until 2000.
