Repurpose schoolbags is a green initiative from Rethaka, a South Africa-based startup.
Thato Kgatlhanye and Rea Ngwane founded the startup to create positive change.
Their 100% recycled plastic schoolbags double as a nightlight for schoolkids.
The bag features a solar panel that is charged during the walk to school.
