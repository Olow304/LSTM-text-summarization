Mychal Bell's case will be heard in juvenile court, Gov. Kathleen Blanco says.
LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters agreed to that, she said.
Bell and five other black teens are accused of beating white student Justin Barker.
Beating followed white students hanging nooses from a tree on school grounds.
