American King, an aircraft ferry service, says the pilot was rescued in "good condition".
Hilo is about 2,300 miles from Monterey, California, where the plane departed from.
The pilot of the Cessna told authorites 500 miles out he was low on fuel and would have to ditch.
He skims the water 13 miles east of Hilo, where he is rescued and flown to a Hilo hospital.
