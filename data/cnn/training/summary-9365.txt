Gen. Henry Rangel Silva will replace Carlos Mata Figueroa, AVN news agency said.
The United States added Rangel to its drug "kingpin" list in 2008.
The action froze Rangel's assets in the U.S. and forbade citizens to do business with him.
President Hugo Chavez reportedly describes Rangel as a "good soldier".
