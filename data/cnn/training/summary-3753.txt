James Fox: LA rampage case is typical of mass murders; like most, planned, methodical.
He says mass murderers tend to be aggrieved middle-aged men, aiming to regain 'power'.
He says in Dorner case, some killed were not actual targets, but cases of 'murder by proxy'.
Fox: Assailant usually thrilled at attention, satisfaction of 'payback'.
