Samuel and Rebecca Yaga's daughter Sarah was kidnapped by Boko Haram in Chibok.
Samuel says he had moved his family there because it had no history of such attacks.
Rebecca says not a day goes by that she does not think of her daughter.
Although in low spirits, the couple remain hopeful that her daughter will return.
