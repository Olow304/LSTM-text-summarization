A Texas judge denied the second attempt by Rick Perry's attorneys to have the felony charges against him thrown out.
Perry pledged to continue to fight the charges, which he said "amounts to the criminalization of politics".
He said he's moving forward with a potential presidential bid, despite the charges.
