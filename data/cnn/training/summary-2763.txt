The facility, called "site 911," is expected to cost the U.S. $25 million to $100 million.
Only U.S. construction firms can bid on the contract; the deadline for proposals is Monday.
The purpose of the site, on an air force base near Tel Aviv, is unclear.
Construction workers will be subject to stringent security regulations.
