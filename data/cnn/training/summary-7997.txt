NEW: Pakistan's prime minister says he wants good relations with the United States.
The U.S. is vacating Shamsi Air Base, which is used by unmanned combat vehicles.
The impact of vacating the air base is likely to be minimal, experts say.
Pakistan told the U.S. to leave the base after an airstrike killed 24 Pakistani troops.
