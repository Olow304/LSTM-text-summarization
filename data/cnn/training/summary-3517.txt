Harmon Parker's nonprofit group helps Kenyans build footbridges over perilous rivers.
The bridges not only save lives; they connect people to schools, markets and health care.
Parker came to Kenya in 1989 as a young missionary with masonry skills.
Because of limited financing, he is able to organize only five or six bridge projects a year.
