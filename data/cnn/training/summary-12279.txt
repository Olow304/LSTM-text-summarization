Mohammed Ayoob: Europe took actions that showed Muslims not viewed as equal.
He says one was ban on buying Iran's oil as part of sanctions for nuclear enrichment.
Other was French senate outlawing denial of Armenian genocide; Turkey denies it.
Ayoob: Many Muslims see these as alienating: double standards applied in judgment of them.
