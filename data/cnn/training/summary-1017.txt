Bank of England archives reveal £5.6 million of gold was transferred days after Nazi siege of Czechslovakia in 1939.
The bank sanctioned the transfer of gold, which is worth an estimated £736.4 million ($1.1 billion) today.
Despite an attempt by the British government to block all Czech assets in the UK, the transfer went ahead.
