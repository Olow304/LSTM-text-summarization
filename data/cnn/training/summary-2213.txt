Ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh is admitted to a military hospital in Sanaa, an official says.
It's the second time Saleh, hurt in a June 2011 attack, has been to the hospital this month.
There are "concerns" that Saleh "still needs more medical procedures," the official says.
After 30 years in power, he stepped down amid domestic and international pressure.
