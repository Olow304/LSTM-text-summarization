NEW: "The fight went out of" Tony Nicklinson after he lost a court case over the right to die.
"Goodbye world the time has come, I had some fun," he says before his death.
Nicklinson, 58, fought for assisted suicide after a stroke paralyzed him.
The court was sympathetic, but said such a major legal change shouldn't come from judges.
