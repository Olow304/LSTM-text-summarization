Jocelyne Cesari: It's not an advance that Saudi Arabia sent two women to the Olympics.
The country sent them to avoid a ban on participating, she says, but situation is dire at home.
Cesari: Saudi women and girls cannot play or watch sports, except girls in private schools.
Saudi Arabia has one of the worst records on women's rights in the world, she writes.
