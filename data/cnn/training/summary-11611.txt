Italy beat the United States 4-0 to win Fed Cup title at home in in Reggio Calabria.
It is the Italians' second Fed Cup success in three years after previously winning it in 2006.
Flavia Pennetta's 7-5 6-2 victory over Melanie Oudin in Sunday's opening singles match gave the Italians an unassailable lead.
The fourth singles rubber was scrapped, and Italy also won the remaining doubles tie.
