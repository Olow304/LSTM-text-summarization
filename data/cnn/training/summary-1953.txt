A NASA spacecraft is set to drop a rocket on the moon at 7:31 a.m. ET Friday.
Four minutes later, the LCROSS probe will follow and crash onto the lunar surface.
The LCROSS probe will relay data back to Earth about water vapor in moon dust.
The debris plumes will be visible through midsize backyard telescopes.
