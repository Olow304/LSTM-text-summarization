Randy Jackson remains on the attack against the men who run the Michael Jackson estate.
"I AM SO AFRAID FOR MY MOTHER..." Randy Jackson tweeted.
Estate lawyer sent e-mail banning Janet, Jermaine, Randy, Rebbie from mom's home.
"Katherine Jackson is completely free to talk to whomever she chooses," lawyer says.
