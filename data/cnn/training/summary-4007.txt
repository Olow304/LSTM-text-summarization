Johnny Manziel is under investigation amid allegations of being paid to sign items.
"Johnny Football" became the first freshman winner of the Heisman trophy in 2012.
Texas A&M coach forbade him from speaking to the media like other freshmen.
Once the ban was lifted, Manziel tweeted photos of himself gambling, partying.
