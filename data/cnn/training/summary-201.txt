Pornographic sex and visceral violence in "Antichrist" shocked early audiences.
Von Trier was accused of misogyny but claims to identify with the female character.
"Antichrist" stars Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe as a bereaved couple.
Von Trier's "The Idiots" (1998) was first mainstream film to show non-simulated sex.
