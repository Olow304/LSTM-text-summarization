Oklahoma governor warns against "jumping to conclusions".
Suspect in beheading, Alton Alexander Nolen, was a recent convert to Islam.
Suspect is in a hospital and will be interviewed once he's "coherent enough," he adds.
The man allegedly beheaded a woman, attacked another; an off-deputy deputy stopped him.
