(CNN) -- Sir Elton John and David Furnish are now husband and husband.

The two married Sunday in Britain, where same-sex marriage became legal earlier this year.

They had a civil partnership ceremony in 2005, after 12 years together.

They have two children -- Zachary Jackson Levon Furnish-John and Elijah Joseph Daniel Furnish-John.

The two men invited people all over the world to join them for the ceremony via Elton John's brand new Instagram feed.
