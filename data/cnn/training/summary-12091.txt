NEW: Bernice King says she weighed lending MLK's Nobel Prize and Bible, but not selling.
A judge has ordered her to turn over the items.
The items will be stored in a safe deposit box that only the court can access.
The judge made the ruling in a case that pits King's daughter against his two sons.
