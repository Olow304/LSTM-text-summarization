A suicide blast occurs at a checkpoint on the perimeter of the U.S. Embassy in Ankara.
A wounded journalist was going to have tea with the U.S. ambassador, he says.
The ambassador has talked with the family of the "excellent" guard killed in the blast.
The bomber, part of a leftist terror group, was known to the U.S., source says.
