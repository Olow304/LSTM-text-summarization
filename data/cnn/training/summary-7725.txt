Many of the key scenes in David Lean's epic 1962 film "Lawrence of Arabia" were filmed in Jordan.
The film celebrates its 50th anniversary this month.
"The Seven Pillars of Wisdom," Lawrence's account of his wartime experiences in the region form the basis for the film.
Many of the locations described in the book and captured in the film are preserved for visitors today.
