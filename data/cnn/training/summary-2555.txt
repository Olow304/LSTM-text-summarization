"Hamas closed the diplomatic option," says spokesman for the Israeli PM.
A spokesman for the military accuses Hamas of holding the people of Gaza hostage.
"We are not the side who is killing ... We are the side being killed," says Hamas spokesman.
The Gaza death toll is higher than the number of people killed there during the 2012 war.
