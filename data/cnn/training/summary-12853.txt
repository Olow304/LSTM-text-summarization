Nadezhda Tolokonnikova was jailed in Russia last year for her part in a "punk prayer".
In September, the Pussy Riot band member went on hunger strike over prison conditions.
In October, she was transferred and her family was not informed of her new location.
Her husband said Friday that he had spoken to her at a Siberian prison where she is now held.
