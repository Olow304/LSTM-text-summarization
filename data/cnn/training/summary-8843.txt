A 64-year-old man dies while waiting to buy tickets for the soccer World Cup in South Africa.
Cape Town police say the pensioner had been number 555 in the queue.
South Africans had waited up to 20 hours as 500,000 tickets were made available.
Problems with ticketing machines had caused further delays at some centers, FIFA said.
