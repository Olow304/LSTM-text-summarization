After losing in the second round at Wimbledon, Roger Federer drops to fifth in the rankings.
The 17-time grand slam champion hasn't been that low since June 2003.
Federer, unusually for him, is set to play in two clay-court tournaments this month.
Federer's slide comes as Britain basks in Andy Murray's Wimbledon title success.
