A maintenance worker for Madrid's subway system found the check Wednesday.
It was in a wallet and made out to a man with a California driver's license.
"It appears that the wallet was stolen on the Metro," a subway system spokeswoman says.
"We have to verify that the origin of the money is not illicit," a police spokesman says.
