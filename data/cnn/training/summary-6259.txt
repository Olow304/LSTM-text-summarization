Rep. David Obey, D-Wisconsin, announced he will not run again after 41 years in House.
Obey disputed GOP claim that he was in danger of losing.
"There isn't a chance of a snowball in Hades" for GOP win in his district, Obey says.
Obey is appropriations chairman and was key to passing health care bill.
