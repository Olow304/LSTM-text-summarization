Chris Christie built his keynote address to RNC on theme of telling tough truths to America.
Errol Louis says the New Jersey governor has to face the tough truths about his own state.
New Jersey's unemployment rate is high, and there are questions about finances, he says.
Louis: Christie's speech went over well, but he didn't mention Romney until late in his talk.
