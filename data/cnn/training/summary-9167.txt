A Chinese developer has built an American-themed town 90 minutes from Beijing.
The settlement is named after Jackson Hole, a scenic valley in Wyoming.
He has sold almost all the houses, with the bigger homes now fetching $1M each.
Richer, educated, urban Chinese express more positive view of aspects of America's image.
