Journalist Johan Nylander covered an international bike race from China into North Korea.
Promised full access while in North Korea, guards later deleted 90 of his photos.
Nylander recovered the photos deemed offensive by government minders.
Deleted photos often showed North Korean security guards, peasants in the countryside.
