Sidney Frank left $100 million to Brown University months before he died.
Frank attended Brown for one year in 1930s, left because he couldn't afford it.
The gift covers tuition, other expenses for neediest accepted applicants.
First students to receive Frank's scholarship for four years graduated Sunday.
