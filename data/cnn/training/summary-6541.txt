New Jersey Devils goalie Martin Brodeur turned 40 on May 6.
He couldn't celebrate because he was about to lead the Devils to the Eastern Conference Finals.
Steve Politi: "No goaltender in NHL history has won more games than Brodeur".
He won his first Stanley Cup at 23; he could win his fourth at an age most players are retired.
