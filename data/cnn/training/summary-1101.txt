Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller are the latest Americans released from North Korea.
North Korea released Jeffrey Fowle last month; he had hoped Bae, Miller would be with him.
Fowle says he would tell the newly released Americans "to keep the faith".
Another former N. Korean detainee, Euna Lee, says the 2 probably want "mundane days".
