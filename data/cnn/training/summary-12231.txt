Mark Berndt, 62, taught at Miramonte Elementary School for more than 30 years.
He pleads no contest to felony lewd acts on 22 girls and one boy, ages 7 to 10.
Girls can no longer eat cookies, their mothers tell the court.
"He deserves to be punished. Back in the day, you burned them in wood," mom tells court.
