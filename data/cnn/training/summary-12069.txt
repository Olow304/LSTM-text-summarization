In Utah, 14 large crosses on public roads honor fallen state troopers.
An atheists' group successfully sued to have the crosses removed from public land.
A federal appeals court panel agreed in a ruling on Wednesday.
The panel said the crosses could be seen as "government endorsement of Christianity".
