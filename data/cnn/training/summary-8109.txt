"Whitey" Bulger was captured in 2011 after 16 years in hiding.
He's charged in 19 killings during the two decades he ran Boston's Winter Hill gang.
A former bookie testified Friday, saying he paid Bulger's group monthly "rent" in cash.
"Their reputation preceded them ... I valued my life as well as those with me".
