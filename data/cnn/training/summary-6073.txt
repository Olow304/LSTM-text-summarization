The No Love Locks campaign seeks to outlaw the practice of affixing padlocks to Paris's historic bridges.
The Pont des Arts bridge is groaning under the weight of 700,000 padlocks and is at risk of collapse, campaigners say.
A petition to ban the locks and move them elsewhere has gained more than 1,700 signatures.
