Anthony Yarbough and Sharrif Wilson were convicted in a 1992 triple murder.
The men have spent 21 years in prison in the deaths of Yarbough's mom, two girls.
New DNA evidence suggests another killer, who committed a crime while they were in prison.
"It was hard to keep my hopes up, but God is good now, I'm out now," Yarbough said.
