Bob Greene says he saw a framed photo of a woman with Elvis Presley.
The woman, he learned, was Elvis's hometown sweetheart just before he made it big.
Barbara Hearn Smith now lives in Tennessee and has fond memories of Elvis.
Greene: She said when his career took off that year, 1956, he went from boy to man.
