Former world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo announces her retirement from tennis.
The 30-year-old holds an emotional press conference, saying she has lost motivation.
She was the first French player, male or female, to reach the top of the rankings.
But her career has been on a downward spiral since suffering injuries during 2007.
