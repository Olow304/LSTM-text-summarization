LZ Granderson says there are a couple of words men should avoid when talking with women.
The words: "Fat" and "weave." But a TV host mentioned his female co-host's weave on air.
Granderson says the male co-host said he didn't know the rule.
Granderson: Men, you can mention almost anything else -- but not the weave.
