NEW: It appears to be the first time Afghan insurgents have worn U.S. uniforms in years.
Insurgents in U.S. Army uniforms attack the camp where Prince Harry is based.
The well-trained, well-armed attackers kill two Marines and destroy six jets.
Four NATO troops killed by Afghan police were American, an official says.
