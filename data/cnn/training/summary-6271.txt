The well-known bugle call's 150th anniversary was Saturday.
Buglers Across America enlisted nearly 200 volunteer buglers and trumpeters to play.
Taps were created because of a Union general's displeasure at the lights-out call at the time.
"This is like Carnegie Hall for me," says New Hampshire trumpeter Allison Cummings.
