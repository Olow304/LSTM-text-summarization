Peter Bergen: Idea of dealing with moderate Taliban is gaining more support.
Bergen says it's not likely to be a strategy for success in the Aghanistan war.
Taliban leadership thinks it's winning the war and won't cut a deal, he says.
Bergen: Afghan government too weak to engage in meaningful talks.
