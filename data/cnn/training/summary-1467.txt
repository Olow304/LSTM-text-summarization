Manchester United announces a club record annual revenue of $580 million.
The English Premier League champion also says sponsorship revenue increased 44 percent.
But most United fans are disappointed the team didn't buy more players in the summer.
United was linked with Cristiano Ronaldo, Cesc Fabregas and Ander Herrera.
