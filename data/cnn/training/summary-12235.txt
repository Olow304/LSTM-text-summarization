Za'atari refugee camp in northern Jordan is home to more than 20,000 Syrian refugees.
Hundreds more arrive every day, on foot, with just the clothes they are wearing.
The refugees are putting pressure on already scarce water resources in the region.
As the situation in Syria escalates, many fear they will be in the camp for some time.
