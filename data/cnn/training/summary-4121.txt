ISIS has established itself as the main jihadist group in the world today.
This has left al-Qaeda struggling to make an impact, according to Quilliam's Ghaffar Hussain.
Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri promises to "raise the flag of Jihad" and spread Islamic rule across S. Asia.
But there are good reasons why India and Bangladesh have not been fertile breeding grounds for jihadists, Hussain says.
