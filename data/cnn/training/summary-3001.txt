The U.S. has a long history in Iraq, including the 1991 Gulf War and 2003 invasion.
As Iraq battles radical Islamist militants, U.S. officials have promised more help.
Air strikes and additional weaponry and aid are among the options being mulled.
But ground troops have been ruled out, according to a White House spokesman.
