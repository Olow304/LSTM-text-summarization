Roland Martin: Mitt Romney is largely blaming minorities for his loss to President Obama.
In a talk with donors, Romney said Obama showered minorities and young voters with "gifts".
Exit polls say 72% of all U.S. voters were white, and Romney received 59% of their votes.
Martin: America should be thankful minorities and young rejected Romney's "nonsense".
