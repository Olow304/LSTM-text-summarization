Gene Seymour: It seemed that Dick Clark would defy physical laws, last forever.
Clark was known for New Year's show, but more so for "American Bandstand".
Seymour: Show was a must-see for kids in the '50s and '60s; it endured even till the '80s.
Seymour: Clark was smooth and with staying power; his loss points out our vulnerability.
