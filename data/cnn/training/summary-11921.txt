U.S. Marshals arrest Aaron Thomas, 39, without incident at his home in New Haven.
Connecticut police say Thomas "has been identified as the East Coast Rapist".
Several agencies claim the DNA links a man to 17 rapes in 4 states.
A Virginia police spokesman says, "We are all breathing a sigh of relief".
