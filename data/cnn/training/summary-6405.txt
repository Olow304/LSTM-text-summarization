City: EPA tests have not found significant levels of chemicals in the air.
The plant's owner says an electrical spark may have caused the blaze.
The plant produced chemicals used in fracking, its CEO tells CNN affiliate WFAA.
A main chemical produced at the plant was anhydrous ammonia, an EPA official says.
