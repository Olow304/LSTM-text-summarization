Elon Musk wants to revolutionize transportation with high-speed trains in enormous pneumatic tubes.
Such trains could theoretically whisk people from Los Angeles to New York in 45 minutes.
A Colorado firm is in the early stages of development of such a system.
Musk is the serial entrepreneur behind Tesla, the electric car company, and Space X.
