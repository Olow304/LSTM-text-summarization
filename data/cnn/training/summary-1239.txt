Poll conducted after government shutdown shows small majority think GOP control of House is bad.
Results are first time since GOP took control of House in 2010 that more oppose its control.
More than six in 10 say Speaker of the House John Boehner should lose his job.
Obama's approval numbers didn't take same hit that GOP's did after shutdown.
