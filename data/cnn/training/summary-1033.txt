Two tourists from Hungary died in the July 2010 accident.
The pilot of a tugboat involved has agreed to plead guilty to a charge, prosecutors say.
A barge being towed by the tugboat hit a sightseeing "duck boat".
The NTSB cited the pilot's use of his cell phone and computer as "the deadliness of distraction".
