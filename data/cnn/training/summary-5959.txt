An anonymous donor drops off a framed piece of art at a Goodwill in Washington state.
Goodwill staff thinks it's "ugly" and declares: "Why would anybody want that?".
But it's a Salvador Dali etching, signed by the master surrealist.
Goodwill is auctioning the Dali on its website until Monday: bidding is now $10k+.
