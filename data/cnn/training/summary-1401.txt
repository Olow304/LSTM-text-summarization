Ex-football player and his mother took out five home loans, indictment says.
Irving Fryar and Allene McGhee secured loans over six days in 2009, papers say.
The pair got $690,000 from the loans, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office says.
Fryar played for four teams from 1984 to 2000; he's now a high school football coach.
