Heidi Schlumpf: Pope Francis met with victims of clergy sexual abuse, begged forgiveness.
She says apology good, but he must do more to make amends with victims, all Catholics.
She says Vatican steps positive; Pope should remove Kansas City bishop who covered up.
Schlumpf: Victims' groups want more action; if they can forgive, they are ones to be commended.
