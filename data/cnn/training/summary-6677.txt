Californians were startled awake this week by Amber Alerts on their phones.
The alerts were the first sent statewide in California under a new program.
Some people were annoyed by the alerts, while others cite them for saving lives.
Ethan Anderson, 8, and sister Hannah Anderson, 16, were abducted last weekend.
