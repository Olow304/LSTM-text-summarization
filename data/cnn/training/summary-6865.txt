Childhood friend of Malawi President Joyce Banda had to drop out of school.
Chrissie's family couldn't pay for school, Banda says, so now she lives in poverty with kids.
Banda: In Malawi, girls often give birth and have no health care.
Banda calls for education, access to birth control to lift families out of poverty.
