Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta tenders his resignation.
He's likely to be replaced by Democratic Party leader Matteo Renzi.
The third largest economy in the eurozone has had more than its share of political turmoil.
Letta was sworn into office last April, ending weeks of uncertainty after inconclusive elections.
