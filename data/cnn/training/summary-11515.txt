Paul Warner Powell was convicted of murdering Stacie Reed and raping her sister.
Afterward, he wrote a taunting letter to the prosecutor giving new details of the crime.
In a second trial, his admission of attempted rape of Stacie got him the death penalty.
The U.S. Supreme Court in January refused to block the execution.
