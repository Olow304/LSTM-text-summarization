A video of homeless veteran Jim Wolf getting a makeover got 14 million views.
It helped raise more than $30,000 for homeless mission in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Wolf, however, continues to struggle; he was arrested shortly afterward.
His sister says Wolf lost hope: "I don't think he can see the trees through the forest".
