Thomas Guolee, 31, is taken into custody in Colorado Springs, a sheriff's office says.
A source had said he was an associate of the white supremacist 211 Crew gang.
Evan Ebel, who authorities suspect killed Colorado's prison chief, was in that gang.
Guolee is being held on no bond for allegedly violating his parole.
