Dan Kennedy: Before Monday, the Boston Marathon marked city's annual "Greatest Day".
It brings the marathon, Patriots Day and an 11:AM Red Sox game; kids are off from school.
Kennedy: Marathon is 26.2 miles, in future, must every mile be checked for bombs?.
Celebration of patriotism, pride, Spring's return irretrievably marred by bomb horror, he says.
