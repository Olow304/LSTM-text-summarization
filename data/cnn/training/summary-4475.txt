Democrat Michelle Nunn has a small 47%-44% edge over Republican David Perdue..
That's according to a new CNN/ORC International survey.
If Nunn wins, she'd be the first Democrat elected statewide in more than a decade.
The gubernatorial race between Gov. Nathan Deal and Democrat Jason Carter is also close.
