David Duchovny's Russian beer ad is released at an awkward time.
"I found out that being Russian, I'd have many things to be proud of," he says in the video.
"I grew up thinking I was Russian only to find recently that I've been Ukrainian," he tweets.
Duchovny and his manager did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
