Earlier this year Sen. Schumer, Rep. Pelosi proposed raising taxes on millionaires.
Reihan Salam says their idea of a higher threshold than Obama's $250,000 could work.
Salam: It wouldn't raise as much money, but would be more politically palatable.
He says another plus is that it wouldn't risk as much of an economic slowdown.
