The NBA says all owners' interests in the team could be terminated.
Donald Sterling tells Anderson Cooper, "I was baited. ... That's not the way I talk".
"I'm not a racist. I made a terrible, terrible mistake," he says.
"If the owners feel I have another chance, then they'll give it to me," he says.
