For centuries, Matera, Italy's rock crypts and maze of grottoes have been home to "troglodyte" outcasts living in inhuman conditions.
Now many of the caves have been converted into upscale "spiritual hotels".
Matera is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and picked as the 2019 European Capital of Culture.
