Manny Pacquiao threatens Floyd Mayweather and his camp with legal action over a drug-testing row.
Pacquiao is angered by demands that he submit to blood-testing in the build-up to a proposed bout.
He claims to have instructed his promoter Bob Arum to file a law suit as soon as possible.
A welterweight match between Pacquiao and Mayweather is slated for Las Vegas on March 13 next year.
