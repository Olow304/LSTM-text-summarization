November 19 is the first U.N. recognized World Toilet Day.
WaterAid chief says over 1 billion people are at risk because they lack access to clean toilets.
"To die for want of a toilet is an outrage that we should not be tolerating," says Barbara Frost.
She says "political will and financing" is needed to address the problem.
