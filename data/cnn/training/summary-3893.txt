Spec. Leslie Sabo Jr. was married for one month before shipping out to Vietnam.
His bride, Rose, says he "was always goofing around. ... We had a ball together".
Sabo died in a firefight in which he shielded his mates from a grenade, took out a bunker.
He will receive the Medal of Honor posthumously from the president on Wednesday.
