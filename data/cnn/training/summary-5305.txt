A Texas man has outfitted a 1939 Ford with a jet engine he hopes will make it go more than 300 mph.
Nicknamed the "Hemi Jet," it fires up this weekend at the Houston AutoRama.
The car has a Chrysler engine, a Chevrolet drivetrain and a Ford body.
Owner Joe Wilkins plans to run it flat-out someday at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.
