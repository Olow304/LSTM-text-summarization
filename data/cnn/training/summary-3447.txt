Moms Helping Moms was born when Bridget Cutler met moms in need in her community.
The nonprofit got its start when Cutler held a garage sale in which all items were free.
Since 2011, it has distributed diapers, clothes, nursing supplies and other baby gear.
Donated new or gently used items go to homeless moms, teen moms and families in need.
