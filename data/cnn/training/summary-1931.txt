Paul Begala says he is appalled by Dick Cheney and his relentless effort to revise history.
Begala: Cheney won't admit any error, misgiving or remorse or apologize for any mistake.
Begala: Cheney misled, lied and did anything to drag America into a war with Iraq.
He says whether Cheney is a liar or fool; thousands of troops are dead; Iraq is a disaster.
