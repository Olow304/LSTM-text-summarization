Held annually in southeastern France, the Marathon du Medoc pits runners against 26.2 miles and many glasses of wine.
Last year 3,300 runners from 53 different nations joined 5,200 competitors from across France.
Organizers lay on extra water stations and medical provisions to help runners cope with the rigors of a boozy run.
