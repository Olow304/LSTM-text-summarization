NEW: Cuba: U.S. -- including "military aircraft, if necessary" -- had OK to use its airspace.
Pilot told air traffic control something was "not correct," but didn't declare an emergency.
U.S. and Cuban aircraft tried to track the small aircraft, but neither could alter its course.
The plane crashed about 14 miles off the coast of Jamaica, authorities say.
