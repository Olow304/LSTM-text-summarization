Jeff Pearlman says he loves the Super Bowl, just hates having to go to a party.
He says when he was young, it was him, with football under arm, the TV, and no talking.
Now a dolt's always blabbing through game and wanting quiet during commercials, he says.
Pearlman says this year he's staying home with family to watch -- in peace and quiet.
