Rodman and several other former NBA stars departed Beijing for North Korea.
Rodman tells CNN that the trip's focus is sport, not politics; he won't discuss Kenneth Bae.
They are due to play a friendly game against a North Korean team on Wednesday.
The game takes place on the birthday of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
