An unauthorized version of popular Hong Kong Thai restaurant Chachawan has opened in Shanghai.
Despite near-identical signage and menu, manager from replica Chachawan says he has no knowledge of the original restaurant.
In addition to fake luxury goods, copycat shops and restaurants lifting entire brand identities are now found in China.
