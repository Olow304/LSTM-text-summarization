Running of the Bulls begins this year on July 7 and is expected to attract thousands of participants.
The annual event usually results in scores of injuries and occasionally fatalities.
The Spanish fiesta was immortalized in print by Ernest Hemingway in his novel "The Sun Also Rises.".
Hemingway's grandson is among those who have produced an e-book on how to survive the bull runs.
