The Khalidiya neighborhood of Homs has been a rebel stronghold for about a year.
The area is crucial because it helps the regime gain control of Homs.
Opposition activists have said the regime has control of about half of Khalidiya.
A capture there could be a turning point in a war that has killed 100,000 people.
