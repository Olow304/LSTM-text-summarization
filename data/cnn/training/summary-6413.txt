Floyd Mayweather has challenged Manny Pacquiao to a fight on May 5.
Mayweather was sentenced to three months in jail for domestic violence in December.
The American received permission to delay reporting to jail in order to fight in May.
But Pacquiao says he would prefer to finally face his rival at the end of the month.
