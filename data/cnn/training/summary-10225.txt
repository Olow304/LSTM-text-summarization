Barclays says it is "truly sorry for what has happened and that you have been let down".
It pledges to work for its clients and customers and earn right to keep their business.
The bank has been rocked by a rate-rigging scandal that has forced out top executives.
Barclays was fined $450 million last month by British and U.S. regulators.
