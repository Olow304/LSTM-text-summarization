A French Red Cross official abducted by militants in Yemen has been freed, the ICRC says.
Benjamin Malbrancke was kidnapped the evening of April 21 about 30 kilometers outside Hodeida.
Malbrancke was traveling with two Yemeni drivers, who were also taken but then released unharmed.
Kidnappings are common in Yemen.
