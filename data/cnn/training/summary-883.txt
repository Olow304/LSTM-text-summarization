Dean Randazzo surfed year around off the New Jersey shore until he went pro.
There were times on pro-tour when he says "I wasn't eating if I didn't win money".
Randazzo also fought and won four battles against cancer.
Surfing documentary "Dark Fall" shows freezing weather doesn't keep surfers off the water.
