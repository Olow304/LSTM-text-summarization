NEW: Murphy's mom: "Reckless innuendos" about drugs should stop.
The coroner says he found that drugs didn't play a role in the British screenwriter's death.
Monjack's cause of death was the same as that of his wife, Brittany Murphy, he says.
Murphy died of a combination of pneumonia and an iron deficiency, the coroner says.
