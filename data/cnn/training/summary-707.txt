The suspect's lawyer says it "was a consensual act, not a sexual assault".
The incident happened in front of a large crowd on the Xfinity Center lawn.
People recorded what happened on their cell phones and provided video to authorities.
"This was a private act that regrettably occurred in a public place," attorney says.
