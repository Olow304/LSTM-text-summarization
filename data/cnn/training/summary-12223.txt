NEW: The ban is needed because of increasing violence at rallies, Bahraini officials say.
Amnesty International calls for the ban on public protests to be lifted immediately.
Amnesty says the ban is a violation of people's rights to free speech and assembly.
Officials shouldn't use "violent acts of a few as a pretext" to restrict the rights of all, it says.
