Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung says the protests "have gone out of control".
He says the protests have also been influenced by external forces beyond Hong Kong.
Weekend clashes between protesters and police left more than 200 people injured.
Talks between the Hong Kong government and student leaders will take place Tuesday.
