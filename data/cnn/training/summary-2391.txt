Johan Christian Tandberg was at the scene when a bomb went off.
He grabbed a camera and started filming.
Tandberg says the 9/11 attacks were the first thing he thought of.
The sounds of alarm bells and broken glass crunching underfoot punctuate the video.
Apparent right-wing extremist Anders Breivik is charged with the bombing and mass shooting that killed 76.
