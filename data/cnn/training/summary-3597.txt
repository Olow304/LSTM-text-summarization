A Human Rights Watch report says Russia has failed to prevent homophobic violence.
It blames a growing number of attacks on a 2013 anti-gay propaganda law.
Authorities are failing to use hate crime legislation to prosecute offenders, the report says.
Russia's President has said no one should face discrimination, calls "traditional families" priority.
