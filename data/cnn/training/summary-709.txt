Three friends set out on a fishing trip on February 24 from San Carlos, Panama.
The boat's engine died; it was found adrift in the Pacific some 600 miles away.
Adrian Vasquez survived on raw fish and rainwater, his mother says.
His friends died, and he had to dispose of their decomposing bodies, she says.
