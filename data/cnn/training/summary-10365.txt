Edward Snowden says NSA analysts can watch people's "thoughts as they type".
"The Constitution of the United States had been violated on a massive scale," he tells NBC.
Snowden says he considers himself a patriot and would like to return to the U.S. someday.
He faces espionage charges in the United States and received temporary asylum in Russia.
