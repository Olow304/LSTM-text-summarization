Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has resigned from Egypt's armed forces to run for president.
Khalil al-Anani says el-Sisi's bid demonstrates the military's desire to consolidate power.
Egypt's Gulf allies have poured money into Egypt and view el-Sisi as a savior, he writes.
The West misguidedly thinks he will bring stability -- when he will create insecurity, al-Anani says.
