Maria Santos Gorrostieta was fearless in the face of assassination attempts.
She was hailed for her bravery, but was found dead last week.
A report says the local drug trade called the shots in her town of Tiquicheo.
Investigators aren't ruling out any possible motives -- political, personal or criminal.
