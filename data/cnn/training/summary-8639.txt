George Lois, renowned adman, says "Mad Men" is nothing like ad world of '60s.
He says the show is riddled with incorrect stereotypes: rampant drinking, adultery, carousing.
He says real "Mad Men" hardworking rule-breakers, expressing roiling counterculture.
Lois: Yes, show is drama, not documentary, but for the record, real Mad Men were nothing like it.
