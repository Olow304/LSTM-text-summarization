Roger Federer has praised Ivan Ljubicic ahead of his retirement next month.
Croat Ljubicic will end his 14-year playing career after April's Monte Carlo Masters.
Former world No. 1 Federer described Ljubicic as a "feared opponent".
Ljubicic won the Davis Cup with Croatia in 2005 and rose to world No.3 in 2006.
