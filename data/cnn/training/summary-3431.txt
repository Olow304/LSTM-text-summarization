John Avlon: The "Restore Sanity" rally emphasized moderation and humor.
He says the big crowd yearned for an alternative to extreme partisanship.
Avlon says some tried to spin it as a liberal event, but the real theme was a centrist one.
Hyperpartisans should "stop trying to divide Americans in an attempt to conquer," he says.
