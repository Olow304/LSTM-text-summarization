Sudan and South Sudan will withdraw their troops from a 14-mile-wide demilitarized zone.
The agreement was brokered by former South African President Thabo Mbeki.
The deal will be implemented "word-by-word and step-by-step," a Sudanese minister says.
South Sudan became an independent nation in 2011, but disputes have persisted.
