During the 2012 race, Mitt Romney was criticized for calling Russia the United States' top "geopolitical foe".
Romney was also haunted by an op-ed about the auto industry entitled "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt".
Now, Russia has granted temporary asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden and the City of Detroit is bankrupt.
But Romney was also hurt in his 2012 White House bid by other controversies like his "47 percent" comments.
